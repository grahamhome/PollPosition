# Poll Position

## Overview 
Poll Position is a platform which enables groups to make democratic decisions and policies. It is designed to uphold the following principles:
* Direct Democracy - Any user may vote directly on any issue, and any user may submit a policy proposal for any issue.
* Ranked-Choice Voting - Users may select multiple preferences for certain decisions to ensure an equitable outcome for all.
* Meritocracy - All users participate in a reputation system which affects the visibility of their policy proposals to others.
* Plurality of Views - Users are exposed to a range of potential options representing perspectives from all sides of the issue.
    * Poll Position's user interface is carefully designed to avoid building premature consensus or presenting users with a false dichotomy.
    
Poll Position is intended to help groups of any size and purpose work together and make the best decisions possible! 

## Usage
Poll Position is currently under development. It can be started locally by installing the packages in requirements.txt and running `python manage.py runserver`.
